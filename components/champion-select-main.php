			<p>To get started with your itemset, we'll need to find which champion you'd like to create an item set for.</p>
			<p>To start building, click on the champion you want from the list on the right, and then click "BUILD CHAMPION!". We also provide some champion stats for you, to help give you a better idea
			of what items you might want to build.</p>
			<p>In the future we're looking into adding:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The ability to search through your recent games, and select a build from there.</li>
				<li>Being able to provide match stats with your summoner id</li>

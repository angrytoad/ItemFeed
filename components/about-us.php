<h1>About us!</h1>
<p>We're a team of lol players who have been playing league of legends for years, with a combined amount of wins over 3,000. We've seen the game we love go through many different phases.
With the release of the new item set documentation, we felt it was our time to shine to make a tool that all players can use and enjoy.</p>
<p>Who we are:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Angrytoad (EUW)</li>
    <li>Jonny le rapiste (EUW)</li>
</ul>
<p>We hope you enjoy using the site and we plan on adding a bunch of extra functionality if the site starts getting used. We hope to one day be used in the same way that people
    use lolnexus or lolking.</p>
<h2>Site Development</h2>
<p>You can find a public gitHub repo of the whole site <a href="https://github.com/angrytoad/ItemFeed" target="_blank">here</a></p>
<h2>Freebies</h2>
<p>I used photoshop to create a nice little background you can use for your desktop, you can find it <a href="/img/free/Background.png" target="_blank">here</a></p>

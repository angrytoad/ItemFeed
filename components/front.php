    <h1>Welcome to ItemFeed</h1>
    <p>
        Hello all, this application was created as part of the Riot Games API Challenge V2 as a way to fully utilise the power or Riot Games' recently released Item Set Documentation.

        ItemFeed will allow you to create a completely custom buy page for your League Of Legends champions in just a few minutes, meaning you can spend less time finding the items for your
        build and more time fighting on the fields of justice.
    </p>
